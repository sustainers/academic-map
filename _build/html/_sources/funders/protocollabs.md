# [`Protocol Labs Research`](https://github.com/protocol/research#private-retrieval)

## About

We are looking for research and development of interactive private communication mechanisms.
Commensurate with scope, up to USD 150k per award for research grants and USD 300k per award for implementation grants.
Works we are interested in funding include those which:

Explore new mechanisms for private communication (e.g. with cryptographic, information theoretic, or statistical basis)
Relax the traditional ‘web’ assumptions of a single origin to engage with the possibilities of pre-distributed CDN or content-addressed data.
Prototype the use of novel network-layer privacy technologies in real systems.

## Eligibility Criteria

Implementation grant
We expect that a team of 2-3 research engineers/developers working for 1-2 years will be sufficient to carry out the prototype development projects envisioned in this call, but we will consider other proposals. Renewals are possible.

## Application

We encourage you to reach out to `research-grants@protocol.ai` or visit `#private-retrieval` in the Lodestar Discord if you’re considering applying or have any questions.

## Deadline

N/A
