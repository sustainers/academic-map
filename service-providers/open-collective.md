# Open Collective Inc

Open Collective Inc. is the for‑profit entity behind the widely used Open Collective platform—an open‑source, transparent financial toolkit launched in 2015 that empowers grassroots communities, open‑source projects, and mutual‑aid networks to raise, manage, and disburse funds without needing their own legal setup or bank account.

**Key features of the Open Collective platform:**

* **Transparent budgeting:** Every transaction—income or expense—is visible to the public, fostering trust and accountability .
* **Flexible contributions:** Supports recurring donations, one-off contributions, custom tiers, and fundraising goals.
* **Easy expense handling:** Contributors submit invoices or receipts, and host admins approve and disburse payments, with live updates to collective balances.
* **Community engagement tools:** Enables posts (“Updates”), discussion threads, events, leaderboards, and embeddable widgets to connect with supporters.
* **Built‑in fiscal hosting:** Allows unincorporated projects to operate under a host’s legal umbrella, bypassing admin burdens like bank setup and tax filing.
