# Overview

â€‹Globus, developed by the University of Chicago, is a research data management platform that facilitates secure, reliable, and high-performance data transfers across various systems and institutions. Originally known for the open source Globus Toolkit, which provided essential grid computing capabilities, the project transitioned to a cloud-based service model to better support the evolving needs of the research community. While the Globus Toolkit was retired in 2018 due to funding constraints, Globus continues to offer robust services like [Globus Connect](https://www.globus.org/globus-connect) and [Globus Flows](https://www.globus.org/globus-flows-service), which are widely adopted in academia for automating data workflows and managing large-scale data transfers.
