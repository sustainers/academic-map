## General Description

The MGB OSPO was formed to support open science activity around the system, which was at the time silo'd and unsupported.  

This support spans Open Access Publication, Open Source Distribution and Open Data. 

## Core Objectives

The OSPOs' main priority is supporting a large open science innovator and developer community that has historically operated outside of system policy and community best practice, and dismissed opportunities for commercialization.
