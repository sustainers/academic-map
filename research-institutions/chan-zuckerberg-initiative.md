## General Description

The Chan Zuckerberg Initiative's (CZI) Open Science Program Office provides strategic leadership in open science to maximise the impact of research and products associated with CZI's scientific Grand Challenges.

The OSPO is situated in Insights, Analytics, and Open Research (a cross-functional team that includes data scientists, monitoring/evaluation experts, and survey scientists). The OSPO works cross-functionally with legal, IT, scitech, data, and other teams to clarify the role of open science in CZI's work in AI, data, and open source. It also serves as a point of contact for external partners in open science.

## Core Objectives

The primary goal of the OSPO is to support both software/product developers and biomedical researchers in CZI and the Biohub network (three locations in Bay Area, Chicago, and New York) in implementing open science practices. 

This includes work related to internal policy (data, AI, and software), best practices in open source development, partnerships/governance and maintaining relationships with external open science communities.
