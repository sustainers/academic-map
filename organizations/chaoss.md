CHAOSS is a community of mixed academics and industry professionals working on defining usable metrics for open source community health (CHAOSS stands for Community Health Analytics in Open Source Software). They have [several working groups](https://chaoss.community/kb/working-groups/), including an OSPO and a University working group. Their work comes partially out of the Universities of Nebraska and Missouri, through [Matt Germonprez](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/about/faculty-staff/matt-germonprez.php) and [Sean Goggins](https://engineering.missouri.edu/faculty/sean-patrick-goggins/). The group is funded and hosted by the Linux Foundation as well as Alfred P. Sloan.

Their work informs several companies that use the metrics to improve open source health for industry and university OSPOs, such as Bitergia. Other companies that use CHAOSS metrics can be found [here](https://chaoss.community/about-chaoss/).
