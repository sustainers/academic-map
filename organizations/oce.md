# Open Collective Europe

[Open Collective Europe (OCE)](https://www.oceurope.org/) is an independent, Belgian-registered nonprofit fiscal host that empowers European grassroots initiatives, social-impact projects, open-source efforts, and civic movements to collect and manage funds transparently—without needing to establish a separate legal entity. Through its fiscal hosting services, OCE holds money on projects’ behalf, processes donations (EU and US tax-deductible when applicable), disburses expenses, and handles administrative overhead—all within the Open Collective platform for transparent budgeting and reporting.

OCE allows you to have 501(c)(3) equibilency, which can be useful for projects receiving donors seeking to write off donations for tax purposes. OCE receives 8-10% overhead on money raised for most projects.
