## Overview

The National Science Foundation (NSF) is a U.S. government agency that supports fundamental research across various scientific disciplines. NSF has been a key advocate for open science, funding numerous initiatives that promote open-source software, data sharing, and reproducible research.

## Open Source Science Support

NSF has provided significant funding to open science initiatives to advance scientific collaboration, computational research, and data transparency. Its investments help drive innovation in research infrastructure and ensure broader accessibility of scientific resources.

### Notable Open Source Science Funding Initiatives

- **[Open Source Science Initiative (OSSci)](https://www.opensource.science/):** OSSci, co-founded by [NumFOCUS](https://github.com/sustainers/academic-map/blob/main/organizations/numfocus.md) and IBM, connects researchers with open-source software communities. It supports interest groups focused on Climate & Sustainability, Reproducible Science, and Healthcare & Life Sciences.

- **NSF Open Source Investment – 2022:** NSF committed **$26 million** to support open-source projects that drive innovation in science and engineering. ([Source](https://new.nsf.gov/tip/updates/nsf-invests-over-26m-open-source-projects))

- **Open Science Policy & Infrastructure:** NSF has been a strong advocate for open-access research through its **Public Access Plan 2.0**, ensuring federally funded research is openly available. ([Source](https://new.nsf.gov/open-science))

- **Open-Source Software for Science:** NSF funds various scientific computing initiatives, including software infrastructure projects that support open-source research tools and data accessibility.
