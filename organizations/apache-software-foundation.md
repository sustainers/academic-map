## Overview

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a decentralized community of developers focused on creating, stewarding, and incubating a broad range of open source software projects. The foundation's products serve as key resources in many scientific open source applications. ASF not only promotes open source methodologies but also provides legal protection to its projects, encouraging scientific community to use and contribute to the open source projects. As per their official website (<https://www.apache.org/>), their projects range from enterprise-level servers, developing libraries, desktop-end software, to Big Data and science tools, providing a collaborative software development environment to welcome contributions from scientists across the globe.
