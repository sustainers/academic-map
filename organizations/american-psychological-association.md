## Overview

The American Psychological Association (APA) is a scientific and professional organization that represents psychology in the United States. It seeks to advance the creation, communication, and application of psychological knowledge to benefit society and improve people's lives. While the APA itself does not create open source software, it supports the principles of open access to scientific research and data and advocates for psychological researchers' contributions to the open science movement. On their website (<https://www.apa.org/>), they provide multiple resources about the importance of open practices in psychological research, including guides on pre-registration and data sharing principles.
