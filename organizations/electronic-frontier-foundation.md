## Overview

The Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) is a leading nonprofit organization advocating for civil liberties and privacy rights within the digital world. As per their website (<https://www.eff.org/>), they aim to ensure that rights and freedoms are protected as the use of technology grows. While they don't primarily focus on open source science, EFF supports the principles of transparency, collaborative development, and the unrestricted sharing of information that the open source model embodies. They also actively defend digital rights, which indirectly aids open source data and knowledge sharing by preserving internet freedoms and fighting against restrictive copyright and patent laws. EFF believes these principles contribute to the public good, encourage innovation, and promote scientific advancement.
