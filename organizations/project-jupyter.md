## Overview

Project Jupyter is an open source project that provides an environment for interactive computing. It was born out of the IPython Project in 2014 and supports several programming languages for scientific computing and data science. It is designed to enable sharing of research, teaching, learning, and scientific collaborations. The project develops and supports Jupyter Notebooks, JupyterHub, and JupyterLab, all of which are open source and can be used for a variety of data science and scientific computing applications. As outlined on their website, Jupyter's mission is to create open standards for reproducible science and interactive computing across different programming languages.
