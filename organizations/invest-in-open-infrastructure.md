## Overview

Invest in Open Infrastructure (IOI) is a non-profit initiative committed to improving the sustainability and availability of open infrastructure. IOI works globally to provide strategic funding insights, research, and advocacy to ensure that the tools and platforms supporting open science and scholarship remain accessible, reliable, and community-governed.

IOI plays a pivotal role in strengthening the open ecosystem through cross-sector partnerships, needs assessments, and capacity-building projects. While IOI does not build open source tools directly, its research and investments support open source projects and organizations across research and education.
