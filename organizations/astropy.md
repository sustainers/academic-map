## Overview

Astropy is a community-developed Python package dedicated to the processing and analysis of astronomical data. It is also a key player in the scientific open source community, promoting the use of Python for astronomical research. The project aims to foster an ecosystem of interoperable astronomy packages and actively supports community-driven efforts. As outlined on its website, Astropy not only provides a core package for astronomy-specific computations and data analysis, but also works in coordination with several affiliated packages dedicated to a diverse range of astronomy and astrophysics applications.
