## Overview:

The Science Gateways Community Institute (SGCI) is a collective organization providing resources, services, experts, and ideas for creating and sustaining science gateways. These gateways are online interfaces that give researchers, educators, and students easy access to specialized, shared resources that are specific to a particular science or engineering discipline. Through their focus on open-source software, SGCI ensures that these resources are freely available, contributing to an open science environment. Their effort in maintaining and developing scientific open source is evident from the range of services they provide, such as software development, usability consultation, and business planning – all intended to improve the access and quality of cutting-edge scientific research.
