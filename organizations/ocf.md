# Open Collective Foundation

OCF was a 501(c)(3) host for projects, some of which were open source projects or were open source adjacent. It was one of the founding members of the Open Collective ecosystem. Due to financial difficulties, [it closed down in 2024](https://blog.opencollective.com/open-collective-official-statement-ocf-dissolution/). [Open Source Collective](./osc.md), its sister project and a 501(c)(6), continues to be the largest fiscal host for open source projects.
