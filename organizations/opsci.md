## Overview

OpSci aims to address challenges in scientific research, such as data accessibility, reproducibility, and funding, by developing platforms and tools that promote collaboration and transparency among researchers.

OpSci is working on several projects that aim to build a decentralized, open-science ecosystem. Below are the major projects, their goals, current status, and recent milestones:

### OpSci Verse

[OpSci Verse](https://github.com/opscientia/society-home#:~:text=OpSci%20Verse) is a decentralized identity and reputation platform for scientists. Its goal is to link researchers’ **"off-chain academic credentials"** to an **"on-chain profile"**, empowering scientists to create a portable digital identity for use across decentralized science (DeSci) applications. This allows researchers to prove their academic credentials on-chain while maintaining control over privacy (they can choose to be pseudonymous or reveal their identity).

### OpSci Commons

[OpSci Commons](https://commons.opsci.io/) is an open-access data commons platform for publishing and discovering large scientific datasets. The initial focus of Commons is on neuroimaging data – it claims to provide free archival, indexing, search, and discovery for brain imaging datasets on a decentralized storage network. Researchers can upload data (after credential verification via Verse) by simply dragging and dropping files, and the system handles decentralized storage plus metadata indexing. It is unclear what, if any, data is currently accessable via OpSci Commons.

### OpSci Fellowship Program

The [OpSci dWeb Fellowship](https://github.com/opscientia/society-home?tab=readme-ov-file#opsci-fellowship) is a 12-week program that supports talented students and early-career researchers in contributing to open source software and research aligned with OpSci’s mission . Fellows receive a stipend and mentorship to work on projects that advance decentralized science. The fellowship is as much about building human capital (educating and training “DeSci” developers/researchers) as it is about producing new tools and research.
