## Overview

The Open Source Science Initiative (OSSci) is a program run by [NumFOCUS](https://sustainoss.org/academic-map/organizations/numfocus.html) that facilitates dialogue between open source research software communities and researchers. Engaging with over 120 organizations, institutions, and open source projects, OSSci develops effective shared solutions to challenges faced by the scientific community and supports the emerging generation of scientists relying on open source tools, data, and code.

## Interest Groups

OSSci has established several interest groups to foster collaboration in specific domains:

- **Climate & Sustainability**
- **Map of Open Source Science (MOSS)**
- **Reproducible Science**
- **Healthcare and Life Sciences**
- **Chemistry and Materials Science**
- **Economics**

Individuals interested in joining these groups can find more information [here](https://chief.sc/ossci-join).
