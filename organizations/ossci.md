## Overview

The Open Source Science Initiative (OSSci) is a program run by [NumFOCUS](https://sustainoss.org/academic-map/organizations/numfocus.html) that facilitates dialogue between open source research software communities and researchers. Engaging with over 120 organizations, institutions, and open source projects, OSSci develops effective shared solutions to challenges faced by the scientific community and supports the emerging generation of scientists relying on open source tools, data, and code.

## Interest Groups

OSSci has established several interest groups to foster collaboration in specific domains:

- **Climate & Sustainability**
- **Map of Open Source Science (MOSS)**
- **Reproducible Science**
- **Healthcare and Life Sciences**
- **Chemistry and Materials Science**
- **Economics**

Individuals interested in joining these groups can find more information [here](https://groups.google.com/a/opensource.science/g/map-of-open-source-science/about?pli=1).

## Funders

OSSci is co-founded by [NumFOCUS](https://sustainoss.org/academic-map/organizations/numfocus.html) and IBM. While additional funders specific to OSSci have not been explicitly detailed, organizations such as NASA, the Chan Zuckerberg Initiative, and the National Science Foundation have supported open source science initiatives more broadly.
