## Overview

OpenAI is an artificial intelligence research lab focusing on ensuring that AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) benefits all of humanity. It is comprised of both for-profit and non-profit branches dedicated to creating AI technologies safely and ensuring those technologies are used for the benefit of everyone. As for scientific open source, OpenAI has a commitment to providing public goods, which includes publishing its AI research. While they anticipate safety and security concerns will reduce traditional publishing in the future, the importance of sharing safety, policy, and standards research will continue. In fact, many significant contributions from OpenAI are broadly accessible in open source projects.
