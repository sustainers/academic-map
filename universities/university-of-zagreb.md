## Overview  

The University of Zagreb (UNIZG) is Croatiaâ€™s largest and oldest university, recognized for its research initiatives in technology, informatics, and interdisciplinary sciences. While UNIZG actively promotes open science and open source collaboration, it **does not currently have a formal Open Source Program Office (OSPO).** However, it has taken steps to integrate open source principles into its research and development ecosystem.  

## Open Source Science Collaboration  

UNIZG participates in and supports initiatives that promote open source and open science practices:  :  

- **Open Science Policy:** In 2024, UNIZG adopted an Open Science Policy aimed at improving accessibility and transparency in research. The policy encourages researchers to store original program code in open repositories like GitHub to foster reproducibility.
