## General Description

The open source programs office (OSPO) raises awareness and capacity for open source software to better develop, manage, curate, and share it for research, education, translation, and broader impact.

As a community convener and center of competency, the OSPO aims to build open source capacity within CMU and beyond, leveraging the institution's research, teaching, and policy expertise to maximize its social impact on a global scale.

## Core Objectives

- Explore open source software and its impact as an underlying component for automated science.
- Examine how both US Federally Funded Research and Development Centers (FFRDCs) and University Affiliated Research Centers (UARCs) can develop open source policies, processes and programs.
- Support wider university services such as student internships and open source educational efforts.
- Build the universityâ€™s capacity to curate, manage and share open source software.

## Primary Contacts

- Thomas Hughes, *OSPO Community Manager*

## Other context

Sayeed Choudury joined CMU last year, coming from his work founding the first University OSPO at Johns Hopkins University. CMU already has a history of open source work done by researchers, but hasn't historically had a centrally operating OSPO to help oversee the work going on. CMU's OSPO was [initially funded](https://sloan.org/grant-detail/10077) by the Alfred P. Sloan foundation, along with several other OSPOs in 2022.
