## General Description

The University of Notre Dame's Center for Research Computing (CRC) is an interdisciplinary hub that provides advanced computational resources and expertise to support research across various domains. The CRC manages high-performance computing systems, develops software tools, and offers services in areas such as data analysis, visualization, and cyberinfrastructure development. 

In alignment with its mission to advance scientific inquiry, the CRC actively engages in open-source software development. Notable projects include:

- **WholeTale**: A scalable, open-source, web-based platform enabling reproducible research by allowing researchers to create, publish, and execute "tales"—interactive, executable research objects. 

- **TaskVine**: An open-source framework designed for building large-scale, data-intensive workflows that operate across high-performance computing clusters and cloud environments. 

Additionally, the CRC maintains a [GitHub organization](https://github.com/crcresearch) where various open-source projects are hosted, facilitating collaboration and code sharing with the broader research community.

Through these initiatives, the CRC demonstrates its commitment to fostering open science and providing tools that enhance the reproducibility and accessibility of research.
