# Universities

University involvement in open source varies widely. For instance, a university could have: a fully structured Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs); a lab or department dedicated to open source; unstructured work done by university staff; investment in open source from libraries or researchers; use of open source edtech internally; taught courses on open source with students; and so on. Because of this, providing a list of universities active in the open source space is hard, and is best thought of as broken down by categories or by usage.

## OSPOs

The following universities have an office which has the standing of an Open Source Program Office:

- [Carnegie Mellon University](./carnegie-mellon-university.md)
- [George Washington University](./george-washington.md)
- [Georgia Institute of Technology](./georgia-institute-of-technology.md)
- [Johns Hopkins University](./johns-hopkins-university.md)
- [Lero](./lero.md) - Technically a Research Center for a collection of universities
- [Penn State](./penn-state.md)

## Labs

There's a host of universities which don't have open source program offices, but which do have labs which do a considerable amount of open source work.

- [Oregon State University](./oregon-state-university.md)
- [University of Nebraska Bridge Lab](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/bridge/index.php) – This lab includes [Matt Germonprez](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/about/faculty-staff/matt-germonprez.php), who works closely with [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/). <!-- TODO Link to Chaoss internally -->
- UMass Amherst [Open Source Computer Lab](https://www.umass.edu/opensource/content/mission.html)
- University at Albany [OSI Lab](https://www.albany.edu/cehc/osi-lab)

## Universities without OSPOs

There are also universities that develop open source software, but don't have policies publicly set for staff or researchers.
