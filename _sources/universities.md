# Universities

University involvement in open source varies widely. For instance, a university could have: a fully structured Open Source Program Offices (OSPOs); a lab or department dedicated to open source; unstructured work done by university staff; investment in open source from libraries or researchers; use of open source edtech internally; taught courses on open source with students; and so on. Because of this, providing a list of universities active in the open source space is hard, and is best thought of as broken down by categories or by usage.

The following universities have some involvement in open source:

  - [Carnegie Mellon University](./universities/carnegie-mellon-university.md)
  - [Georgia Institute of Technology](./universities/georgia-institute-of-technology.md)
  - [Johns Hopkins University](./universities/johns-hopkins-university.md)
  - [Rey Juan Carlos University](./universities/rey-juan-carlos-university.md)
  - [Oregon State University](./universities/oregon-state-university.md)
  - Rochester Institute of Technology
  - [UC Santa Cruz](./universities/university-of-california-santa-cruz.md)
  - University of Texas Austin
  - [University of Vermont](./universities/university-of-vermont.md)
  - [Oregon State University](./universities/oregon-state-university.md)
  - [University of Wisconsin-Madison](./universities/university-of-wisconsin-madison.md)

## Labs

There's a host of universities which don't have open source program offices, but which do have labs which do a considerable amount of open source work.

- [University of Nebraska Bridge Lab](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/bridge/index.php) – This lab includes [Matt Germonprez](https://www.unomaha.edu/college-of-information-science-and-technology/about/faculty-staff/matt-germonprez.php), who works closely with [CHAOSS](https://chaoss.community/). <!-- TODO Link to Chaoss internally -->

## Universities without OSPOs

There are a host of universities that develop open source software, but don't have policies publicly set for staff or researchers.

- University of Cambridge – [IT services has some code available](https://www.dns.cam.ac.uk/about/floss.html).
