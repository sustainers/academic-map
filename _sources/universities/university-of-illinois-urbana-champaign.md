## General Description

The University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign (UIUC) actively fosters open source initiatives through various programs and resources. The National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) hosts numerous open source projects, including Clowder, an open source data management system; BrownDog, aimed at developing data transformation tools; and Rokwire, a mobile software platform for smart communities. Additionally, UIUC's Office of Technology Management supports faculty interested in releasing software via open source licensing, providing guidance on licensing options and intellectual property considerations.

The university also offers resources like the Scholarly Commons, which compiles lists of open source alternatives to proprietary software, and the CARLI initiative, supporting the creation and editing of open educational resources. Furthermore, UIUC hosts events such as the Summer School in Open Science and Research Software Engineering, designed to enhance skills in developing sustainable research software and practicing open science. Student organizations like Open-Source @ Illinois provide platforms for collaboration on open source projects, offering workshops and opportunities to contribute to tools relied upon by the community.
