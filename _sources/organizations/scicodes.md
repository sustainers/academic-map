## Overview  

SciCodes, established in 2021, is a consortium of academic, disciplinary, and institutional software registries and repositories. Its primary goals include sharing methodologies, creating virtual registry standards to enable cross-registry searches, and fostering a collaborative ecosystem for scientific software. By advocating for best practices in software management, SciCodes enhances the discoverability, sustainability, and reusability of scientific software, enabling researchers to integrate these tools into their work seamlessly.

# Members  

The SciCodes Consortium was initially established by members of the **Best Practices for Software Registries Task Force** ([Repository Link](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg/tree/master/Repositories)), which originated from the **FORCE11 Software Citation Implementation Working Group** ([Working Group Link](https://github.com/force11/force11-sciwg)). It later expanded to include participants from the **Scientific Software Registry Collaboration Workshop** ([Workshop Link](https://asclnet.github.io/SWRegistryWorkshop/)), along with others editing similar resources.

## Funders  

SciCodes’ activities and initiatives are supported by multiple funders committed to enhancing the discoverability and sustainability of scientific software.

## Academic Collaborations  

SciCodes collaborates with academic and research institutions to enhance the discoverability, accessibility, and usability of scientific software repositories. The consortium supports a wide range of disciplines, from astronomy to computational geodynamics and bioinformatics.  

Some notable collaborations include:  

- **California Institute of Technology (Caltech)**: Works with CaltechDATA, a repository supporting data and software preservation.  
- **Harvard University**: Utilizes Harvard Dataverse for data sharing and citation.  
- **Institut Pasteur**: Engages with initiatives like ELIXIR Europe and bioinformatics projects through its Bioinformatics and Biostatistics Hub.  
- **Zenodo (CERN)**: A member repository supporting open science by preserving and sharing software and data.  
- **University of Maryland**: Home to the Astrophysics Source Code Library (ASCL), focusing on software for astronomical research.  
- **Gifu University, Japan**: Collaborates on scientific data preservation and workflow standardization.  

Additionally, SciCodes supports **[ShowYourWork!](https://github.com/showyourwork/showyourwork)**, a workflow designed for creating reproducible and open scientific articles. This tool was developed by **Kaze Wong** of the Flatiron Institute.  

These collaborations reflect SciCodes’ commitment to advancing the state of scientific software and fostering a global research community. SciCodes also organizes workshops, monthly presentations, and conferences to share insights and establish best practices in software registries and repositories.
