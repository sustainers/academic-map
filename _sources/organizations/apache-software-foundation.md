## Overview

The Apache Software Foundation (ASF) is a decentralized community of developers focused on creating, stewarding, and incubating a broad range of open source software projects. The foundation's products serve as key resources in many scientific open-source applications. ASF not only promotes open-source methodologies but also provides legal protection to its projects, encouraging scientific community to use and contribute to the open-source projects. As per their official website (<https://www.apache.org/>), their projects range from enterprise-level servers, developing libraries, desktop-end software, to Big Data and science tools, providing a collaborative software development environment to welcome contributions from scientists across the globe.
