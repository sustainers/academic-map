# [NSF Safety, Security, and Privacy of open source Ecosystems (Safe-OSE)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems/nsf24-608/solicitation)

## About

Safe-OSE aims to "address  safety, security, and/or privacy vulnerabilities
proactively in existing, mature OSEs". It encourages submissions which aim to
address both technical and socio-technical issues within existing mature OSEs.
Importantly, Safe-OSE is inclusive of all types of OSEs, not limited to
software-based ones, but also encompassing scientific methodologies,
manufacturing processes, materials formulations, programming languages,
hardware instruction sets, system designs, and data platforms.

Proposers are expected to demonstrate a thorough understanding of their OSE's
threat landscape and provide a realistic plan to mitigate identified risks. The
goal is to catalyze meaningful improvements that the OSE currently lacks the
resources to undertake. Proposals should not focus on fundamental research or
resolving known bugs but rather on strategies that will fundamentally improve
the OSE's resilience against adverse events over the long term.

Safe-OSE requires the submission of a **preliminary proposal** in order to be
invited to submit a **full proposal.**

### Preliminary proposal

Preliminary proposals should have the following qualities & objectives (as per the solicitation):

    Describe the current status of the targeted OSE and provide pointers to the OSE managing organization and the public repositories for the open source product. As the PAPPG does not permit URLs in the Project Description, use the References Cited section of the proposal to identify the appropriate resources.
    Describe the national/societal/economic impacts of the OSE.
    Articulate the targeted classes of safety, security, and/or privacy vulnerabilities to be addressed and the broader impacts of addressing them. Discuss, as appropriate, the potential attacks that could take advantage of these vulnerabilities.
    Briefly describe a development plan to address these vulnerabilities.
    Briefly describe an evaluation plan to assess the efficacy of the work.
    Provide information to substantiate compliance with the eligibility requirements.

Preliminary proposals require the above to be up to 5 pages.

### Full Proposals

Full proposals are submitted according to the NSF PAPPG guidelines. Further details can be found on [the solicitation](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/safe-ose-safety-security-privacy-open-source-ecosystems/nsf24-608/solicitation).

### Estimated number of awards

#### 10 Total

Each award will be for 24 months. The budget for Year 1 should be up to a maximum of $500,000 and the budget for Year 2 should be up to a maximum of $1,000,000, for a total budget of up to $1,500,000 per award.

Estimated program budget, number of awards and average award size/duration are subject to the availability of funds.
