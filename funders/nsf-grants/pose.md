# [NSF Pathways to Enable open source Ecosystems (POSE)](https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/pose-pathways-enable-open-source-ecosystems)

## About

POSE is aimed to develop Open Source Ecosystems (OSE) around existing open source products developed within academia. Those applying should view POSE as a similar pathway of translation of scientific innovation to more sustainable forms. In NSF words:

> POSE constitutes a new pathway to translate scientific innovations, akin to the Lab-to-Market Platform that NSF has pioneered over many decades. Whereas programs like the NSF Innovation Corps (NSF I-Corps™) and America’s Seed Fund [Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) and Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR)] represent an integrated set of programs to provide researchers with the capacity to transform their fundamental research into deep technology ventures, POSE is specifically focused on another translational pathway – supporting the transition from open source research artifacts to OSEs.

POSE is **not** meant to fund the development of projects or existing well-resourced ecosystems. This is rather meant to supporting the development of **new OSEs**.

There are two types of POSE proposals:

### Phase I

Phase I proposals should have the following qualities & objectives:

- Small community of external users (but not necessarily contributors)
- Seeking to develop a plan for community sustainability
- Seeking to provide training & resources to maintainers and other stakeholders trying to build an OSE

### Phase II

Phase II proposals should have the following qualities & objectives:

- Existing small community of **both** contributors and users.
- Seeking to execute and deliver upon a detailed project plan (similar to those funded in Phase I) to support the further development and sustainability of the OSE.

Phase II proposals do not necessarily need to have completed or have been funded for Phase I.

### Estimated number of awards

#### 30 to 50 Total

Approximately 20 Phase I awards of up to $300,000 per award with durations up to 1 year and 10 Phase II awards of up to $1,500,000 per award with durations up to 2 years are anticipated, subject to the availability of funds and quality of proposals received.
