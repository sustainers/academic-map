# Funders

Open source in academia would not be possible without extensive funding support. This support breaks down in two main ways: governmental bodies and private philanthropy. There are exceptions.

Each country tends to have their own particular funding landscape.

New Zealand has a complicated funding relationship. Previously, the sciences were all held under the same department, the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research. This was split in 1992 into separate [Crown Research Institutes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crown_Research_Institute) (CRIs).
